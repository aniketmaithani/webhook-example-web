- The objective of this app is to demonstrate a sample webhook capture request. 
- A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately.


## Running the application 
- Clone the repo on your system
- For e.g sake we are using `sqlite3` as the database but you can configure other db's also
- Once you've cloned the repo, activate your `virtualenv`
- Install `pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt` file while you are in dev mode
- Once the setup is completed, run migration `python manage.py migrate`.
- Once this is done create superuser : `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Run the app : `python manage.py runserver` 

## Sample Endpoint : 

- The app has a sample endpoint at 
```
/api/callback_url
```

### Type of Request : Only POST METHOD ALLOWED
